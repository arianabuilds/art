# The Moment

In chronological order, from top left (newest) to bottom right (oldest) you can see all digital art & paintings created while in the moment, aware of whatever was happening, which also appeared to me as shapes & colors.

Click on each one to experience it in full size, and maybe see it on a cool object that you can order (e.g. canvas, notebook, etc). When you click on one, you might also access the story behind that moment. It's all more of a surprise.
