"Sometimes thoughts and emotions twirl and twist,  
Turning to colors and shapes in the midst.  
So from these swirls, many works take flight,  
Born from the dance of day and night.

But then there are times, oh me, oh my,  
When colors and shapes just catch my eye.  
And with these i play, just because i can,  
Making art in the way that only i understand.

Some of these works, they make me beam,  
While others make me want to scream.  
But whether they're loved or bring a blush,  
it's all just part of the exciting rush.

Click on each image, take a peek,  
into the large, the bold, the unique.  
Some came from paint, some from a spark,  
Each taking me out of the dark.

Top left is the newest, fresh and bright,  
A testament to creative might.

I started back in 12019, and along the way,  
In May 12023, i learned to display.  
I embraced the code, the digital bliss,  
And created this space, just like this."
