# While in the moment with it...

it = equanimity, rage, excitement, pain, love, curiosity, trauma, playfulness, craving, aversion, breath...

In chronological order, from bottom right (oldest) to newest, you can see all created while in the moment with whatever was happening. Click on each one to experience it in full size, see it on a cool object (e.g. canvas, notebook, etc) that you can order, and maybe read what was happening in that moment.
