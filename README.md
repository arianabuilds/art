# Art Sharing & Archive 

I wanted to have a long-long-term solution to be able to store & share the digital drawings and paintings i often create, and have created in the last 4 years. Something like the instagram feed, but in my control.

## Deployed https://art.landedonearth.com

## Storing Images
To begin with, all images are stored in a different github repo, so that we can better optimize space. Mine is https://github.com/arianabuilds/art-images. That's also where we generate links for each image and make thumbnails so that we minimize load time on the main website. 

## Art Website Capabilities
The main art website (https://art.landedonearth.com) currently offers the following capabilities:
1. Images automatically upload from the art-images repo
2. I wanted to see the big picture of what i've created as one big square, so the images are initially:
   - presented in a grid
   - arranged from newest (top-left corner) to oldest
3. There is a slider so that the viewer can adjust the grid and make it smaller or bigger, depending on personal preference
4. Modal/SlideShow-ish:
   - when you click on an image it opens in full
   - you can use the arrow keys or click on the arrows to move through the grid
   - the dates are displayed under the image
5. There is a Description underneath the grid to mumble, but not grumble, about whatever

## Thanks
This project was created thanks to:
1. Patience
2. David: http://github.com/dsernst who often helped me get unstuck, underestand how to design and develop such system, and how to think about more complex topics such as generating thumbnails & automating scripts
3. ChatGPT: https://openai.com/product/chatgpt which helped me feel less intimidated by writing code, understand errors, learn more about how to write Javascript, and it wrote a bunch of the code itself
4. This project is built on top of the Nextra Blog Theme: https://nextra.site/docs/blog-theme which made it easier to get the project started
5. Tailwind: https://tailwindcss.com which makes designing everything way easier and look pretty good

## Code Usage
MIT License  
If you want to display your work and want an option that gives you control, while being relatively easy to implement, this can be it.
